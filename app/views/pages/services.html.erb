Call us at (877) AGILITY or email us at sales@agilitynetworks.com .

IT Consulting Projects Include:

Upgrades and Migrations – Along with business growth and as technologies evolve it's essential to maintain an IT environment that will support key business functions. At some point during an organization's life span, the need to renovate business systems becomes a must. Agility regularly scopes these endeavors, keeping “business case”, budgets and future needs at the forefront of our planning.
Virtualization Projects – Choosing the right virtualization technology can be a daunting task. Let Agility help you think-through your options and design the most appropriate virtualization solution for your business.
Cloud Migrations – Moving to a cloud based environment is a serious move that is less simple than many providers claim. Agility explores these moves thoroughly in order to establish the best plan and ensure that there is a full understanding of the cost, business operation and usability implications of such a move.
New Office Moves – With proper timing and communication we help companies have fluid transitions from one location to the next.  A lot of planning takes place so that down time is kept to a minimum and your employees are 'ready to go' at your new office space.
Network Design and Implementation – Our consultants become familiar with organization’s particular needs and business goals. We have the knowledge and experience to collaboratively design sound and reliable network systems in order to ensure maximum reliability, efficiency and scalability.
Multiple Branch Locations – Designing, deploying and supporting multiple offices can be a complex task, but with proper planning and execution it can turn into a seamless process.
Wi-Fi Implementations – Although a relatively ubiquitous element of network systems these days, not all equipment or solutions are 'one size fits all'. We properly assess with onsite surveys, addressing security and wireless business needs.
